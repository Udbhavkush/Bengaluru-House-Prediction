I built this project to clear my basics of data science.
This is house cost prediction website which predicts the cost of houses based on size of the house (in square foots), number of rooms in the house, number of bathrooms
in the house and the location of the house. The model is trained on the dataset which is based on Bangalore city house prices from kaggle.com.

-> The model uses sklearnlibrary and linear regression on the dataset.

-> Numpy and pandas libraries were used to data cleaning.

-> Matplotlib library was used for data visualization.

-> Sklearn library was used for model building.

-> Python flask server was used to create http server.

-> HTML, CSS and javascript was used to create the UI and the website elements.
